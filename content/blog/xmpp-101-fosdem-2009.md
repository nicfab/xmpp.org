This is a (almost) cross-post from Remko Tronçon’s blog at [http://el-tramo.be/](http://el-tramo.be/)

The slides of the *“XMPP 101”* talk that [Peter St.Andre](http://stpeter.im/) and Remko Tronçon gave at FOSDEM 2009 are available below as a SlideShare presentation and [here in PDF format](http://el-tramo.be/files/blog/xmpp-101-fosdem.pdf).

This presentation gives a fast-paced introduction to XMPP, and is mostly based on [“XMPP: The Definitive Guide”](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596157197/).

Peter and Remko were the first of a series of speakers in the XMPP devroom. We'll hopefully be publishing slides provided by the other speakers shortly.
