It has been a little over a year since Meta [announced](https://engineering.fb.com/2024/03/06/security/whatsapp-messenger-messaging-interoperability-eu/) their [proposal](https://developers.facebook.com/m/messaging-interoperability/) for third-parties to achieve messaging interoperability with WhatsApp, with Facebook Messenger following half a year later. Not for everyone, and only because these services were designated as Gate Keepers under the recent [Digital Markets Act (DMA)](https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/about-dma_en) in the EU. So only in the EU, and then with many strings attached. In that time, a lot has been written. Element/Matrix have put in efforts to work with Meta to get some interoperability going. Unfortunately, the reference offers don't provide what we would call true interoperability, and given that virtually nobody has taken up Meta on this offer, their proposal just falls short across the board.

Over at the IETF, the [More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI) working group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mimi/about/) is working on mechanisms for interoperability. While several of our members are involved with MIMI and working on the implementation of the related [MLS protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/about/) for end-to-end encryption, we believe it is time to have true interoperability using a well-tested and widely implemented set of standards: XMPP.

To that end, we today publish an [Open Letter to Meta](/announcements/open-letter-meta-dma/). A call to action, urging Meta to adopt XMPP for messaging interoperability. For a more in-depth reasoning, we also provide a [detailed technical briefing](/announcements/open-letter-meta-dma/technical-briefing).

We are ready. Let's make it happen.
