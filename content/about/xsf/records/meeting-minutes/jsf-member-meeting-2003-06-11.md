2.  **Items Subject to a Vote**
    1.  RESOLVED that the following Section 2.9 be added to the JSF
        Bylaws:

        **Section 2.9 __Terms of Membership__.** Membership in the
        Corporation shall be valid for a period of one (1) year,
        measured from the date of the Members' meeting at which the
        member was admitted or last re-admitted. In order for an
        individual's membership not to lapse after 12 months, the member
        must (i) re-apply during the membership application period that
        begins 12 months after the application period during which the
        member last applied and (ii) be re-admitted in accordance with
        the procedures defined in Section 2.1. For the purposes of
        instituting this policy, members accepted in 2001 shall re-apply
        in July 2003 and members accepted in 2002 shall re-apply in
        October 2003; thereafter, members shall re-apply according to
        the 12-month rule (e.g., members accepted in January 2003 shall
        re-apply in January 2004).

    2.  RESOLVED that the following Section 8.3 be added to the JSF
        Bylaws:

        **Section 8.3 __JSF Work Teams__.** The Board of Directors or
        the Members of the Corporation may, by resolution, establish one
        or more JSF Work Teams ("Teams"). Participation in Teams shall
        be limited to elected Members of the Corporation. The Board
        shall approve, or the Members shall elect, the chair of each
        such Team. Unless elected or appointed as an officer in
        accordance with Article 6 of these Bylaws, a member of a Team
        shall not be deemed an officer of the Corporation.

        Each Team shall be responsible for the active management of one
        or more projects identified by resolution of the Board or of the
        Members of the Corporation as of importance to the affairs of
        the Corporation, or shall act in an advisory capacity to the
        Board or a Committee of the Board. The specific nature of the
        Team's responsibilities shall be defined by a Team Charter,
        which must be approved by the Board. The Charter shall also
        define the process by which Team members shall be chosen or
        approved. The chair of each Team shall be primarily responsible
        for the advisory functions and work items of the Team, and the
        chair shall establish rules and procedures for the day-to-day
        management of the Team's activities, consistent with the Team
        Charter. All Teams shall report to and be supervised by the
        Board of Directors, and Team budgets must be approved by the
        Board.

        The Board of Directors or the Members of the Corporation may, by
        resolution, remove a Team chair or terminate a Team at any time
        for any reason. A Team shall not be considered a committee of
        the Board of Directors. A Team may not have and may not exercise
        any of the power and authority of the Board of Directors.

    3.  RESOLVED that Section 8.2 of the JSF Bylaws be amended to read
        as follows:

        **Section 8.2 __Jabber Interest Groups__.** The Board of
        Directors, the Jabber Council, or the Members of the Corporation
        may, by resolution, establish one or more Jabber Interest Groups
        ("JIGs"). A JIG is an open forum in which the Jabber community
        may discuss topics that are addressed officially by a JSF Work
        Team or the Jabber Council. While a Work Team or the Jabber
        Council may take account of JIG discussions when making
        decisions related to its responsibilities, it is under no
        obligation to do so, and a JIG does not act in an official
        advisory capacity to a Work Team or the Council. Because a JIG
        is an open forum, participation in a JIG shall not be limited to
        elected Members of the Corporation, and shall be open to any
        interested individual. Leadership and direction for a JIG shall
        be provided by the members (and in particular by the Chair) of
        the relevant JSF Work Team or the Jabber Council.

        Unless elected or appointed as an officer in accordance with
        Article 6 of these Bylaws, a member of a JIG shall not be deemed
        an officer of the Corporation. Unless elected as a Member of the
        Corporation in accordance with Article 2 of these Bylaws, a
        member of a JIG shall not be deemed a Member of the Corporation.

        The Board of Directors, the Jabber Council, or the Members of
        the Corporation may, by resolution, terminate a JIG at any time
        for any reason. A JIG shall not be considered a committee of the
        Board of Directors, of the Jabber Council, or of the Members of
        the Corporation. A JIG may not have and may not exercise any of
        the power and authority of the Board of Directors, the Jabber
        Council, an approved JSF Work Team, or the Members of the
        Corporation.

    4.  RESOLVED that Section 8.1 of the JSF Bylaws be amended to read
        as follows:

        **Section 8.1 __Jabber Council__.** The Corporation shall
        have an advisory council ("Jabber Council") to provide technical
        advice to the Corporation, to approve changes to the Jabber
        protocol, and to oversee and direct the activities of certain
        Jabber Interest Groups. In discharging its responsibilities, the
        Jabber Council shall adhere to the policies, procedures and
        standards approved by the Board of Directors.

        The individuals on the Jabber Council shall be elected by an
        affirmative vote of a majority of the Members of the Corporation
        voting, at each annual meeting of the Members. The individuals
        elected to the Jabber Council shall, by an affirmative majority
        vote of those present and voting, appoint the chair of such
        Council. All the individuals elected to participate on the
        Jabber Council must be Members of the Corporation.

        If a Council member resigns his or her membership in the
        Corporation, is removed from membership in the Corporation, or
        is terminated from membership in the Corporation, he or she
        shall thereby relinquish all rights and responsibilities as a
        member of the Council. In addition, a Council member may be
        involuntarily removed from the Council by an affirmative vote of
        two-thirds (2/3) of the members of the Council. The Council
        shall at its discretion determine whether to fill any vacancies
        on the Council caused by resignation or removal of an existing
        Council member.

        The Jabber Council shall not be considered a committee of the
        Board of Directors. The Jabber Council may not have and may not
        exercise any of the power and authority of the Board of
        Directors. The Jabber Council shall act upon the affirmative
        vote of a majority of the members of the Council voting,
        although the negative vote of any one member of the Council
        shall function as a veto. A quorum of the Jabber Council shall
        be a majority of the members of the Council. The provisions of
        these Bylaws with regard to meetings, notice, etc. that apply to
        Membership meetings shall apply to the Jabber Council and
        members thereof unless such provisions are inconsistent with
        this Article VIII. The Jabber Council shall keep regular minutes
        of its proceedings and report the same to the Board.
